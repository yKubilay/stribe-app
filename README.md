# Stribe app



## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## USER MANUAL 

Prior to running Stribe on your local machine, NodeJS needs to be installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Then the git project can be cloned either into the terminal or preferrably into VScode.

After cloning the Git repository, open your terminal in VScode and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run npm build:

```sh
npm run build
```

Lastly, run the following command and wait for your browser window to appear:

```sh
npm run dev -- --open
```

Now the application runs in your browser window locally, with Hot Module Replacement(HMR) active from Vite.


## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
